- **Result**: ~10% improvement on small operations

**Phase 8: Zero-Copy Views**

- Metadata-only reshape (O(1) operation)
- Metadata-only transpose (stride manipulation)
- Metadata-only slice (view over same Arc)
- **Result**: Zero allocation for view operations

**Phase 9: Parallel & SIMD Execution**

- Rayon parallelization for large tensors (threshold: 50k elements)
- SIMD kernels (add, sub, mul, matmul with tiling)
- Dataset batching (1024-row chunks)
- **Result**: 2.5x speedup on 100k-element vectors

**Phase 10: Resource Governance**

- Arena-backed tensor allocation via `ExecutionContext`
- Memory limit enforcement (default 100MB per context)
- `ResourceError` for limit violations
- **Result**: Production-ready resource controls

**Phase 11: Allocation Optimization**

- Tensor pooling for common sizes (128-8192 elements)
- Size threshold optimization (256 elements)
